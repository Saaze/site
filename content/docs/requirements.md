Before you [get started](/docs/quick-start) with Saaze, make sure your are running **PHP v7.3 or higher**. To check the version of PHP you are running, use the following command in your terminal:

```bash
php -v
```

You should see some output similar to the following:

```bash
PHP 7.4.9 (cli) (built: Aug  7 2020 19:23:06) ( NTS )
Copyright (c) The PHP Group
Zend Engine v3.4.0, Copyright (c) Zend Technologies
	with Zend OPcache v7.4.9, Copyright (c), by Zend Technologies
```

The first line will show what version of PHP you are running.

You also need to make sure you have [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) installed:

```bash
composer -V
```

The above command should output the version of Composer that you are running.
