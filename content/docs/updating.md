title: Updating Saaze
---

When you need to update Saaze in the future, use Composer to update the `saaze/core` package:

```bash
composer update saaze/core --with-dependencies
```

On rare occasions, your site files will also need updating. Unfortunately, there is no easy way to achieve this without overwriting any customizations you might have made. In these cases, we'll outline exactly what files need updated and what steps you need to take in the [<i class="fe fe-external-link pr-1"></i>changelog](https://github.com/Saaze/saaze/releases).
